# Overview

![](https://discosat.dk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/satnogs.png)

The DISCO project will launch 3 satellites into Low Earth Orbit over the next three years. To communicate with the satellites we need to have ground stations that manage the radio communications links for telemetry and data transfer.

The DISCO project is building both fixed ground stations at the participating universities, as well as mobile ground stations that can be loaned to schools in the program.

In this workshop we cover the basics of ground station operation and building including demos and a chance to get hands on experience with a range of equipment, both mobile and some new fixed equipment that will be installed at ITU.

# Documentation

This is a hands on workshop and we would like to take the opportunity to begin a knowledge base on DISCOS ground station topics. 

We have provided basic notes for each topic and activity, and would like you to extend this during the day.

For this workshop we will try out using a github repository and wiki to generate documentation of the day.

Please add documentation to this github wiki. Please add comments, clarifications, links or or other resources you find to any of the workshop activity pages. Feel free to start new pages as necessary.
