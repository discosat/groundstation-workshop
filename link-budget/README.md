# Link Budget calculation

**What is the smallest diameter dish we need to communicate with DISCO 2 using S-Band?**

Use the IARU link budget spreadsheet to work out the link budget for different DISCO ground station antennas listed below.

Large dishes have significant issues in terms of wind loading, roof placement and rotator sturdiness, pointing accuracy, rotator sturdiness etc.

(bigger dishes have narrow beams and hence need more accurate rotators)
